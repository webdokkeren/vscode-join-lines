# Join lines for VS Code

> This extension tries to mimic the join_lines command that you know and love from Sublime Text. It's not perfect yet, but it works pretty much like it.

## Functionality

When I recently started using Visual Studio Code I quickly started missing the join lines command which I had become addicted to in Sublime Text 3.
So I decided to create an extension that implement's that functionality.

**Join lines for VS Code** employ's the [ctrl+j] shortcut to join the line below your cursor to the one youâ€™re currently editing.
This is handy if you want to join the following line with the current one without having to go through all the whitespace in between, with this extension installed just use [ctrl+j]
